## Project Overview
This project is inspired by the research paper:  
[Exploring the Evolution of Quantum Computing: A Comparative Study of Grover’s Algorithm and Conventional Binary Search](https://doi.org/10.23880/oajda-16000153).

The primary goal is to analyze the efficiency and performance of **Grover’s quantum search algorithm** compared to the classical **Binary Search** algorithm. The implementation and experiments were conducted using **Python** and **Qiskit**, focusing on runtime comparisons and theoretical speedups.

## Key Concepts
- **Quantum Principles**: Superposition, Entanglement, and Quantum Gates.  
- **Grover’s Algorithm**: Provides a quadratic speedup in searching unsorted datasets, reducing complexity from O(N) to O(√N).  
- **Binary Search**: A classical algorithm efficient on sorted datasets with O(log N) time complexity.  
- **Qiskit Framework**: Used for simulating quantum circuits and running Grover’s search experiments.

## Features
- Implementation of **Binary Search** in Python.  
- Implementation of **Grover’s Algorithm** using Qiskit.  
- Runtime comparison experiments with random datasets.  
- Visualization of performance metrics.  
- Insights into limitations of quantum simulations vs. real quantum hardware.
